# Design Patterns in Golang

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Design Patterns in the Go programming language.

> **Note**: All code examples are for educational purposes to practice design pattern implementations.

## Pattern Categories

### Behavioral Patterns
These patterns focus on communication between objects, how they interact and distribute responsibilities.

#### Most Commonly Used
- ⭐ **Mediator** - Defines simplified communication between classes
- ⭐ **Strategy** - Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms

#### Others
- **Template Method** - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm
- **State** - Alters object behavior when state changes
- **Observer** - Notifies dependents of state changes
- **Iterator** - Sequential access to elements
- **Command** - Encapsulates a request as an object
- **Chain of Responsibility** - Passes request along a chain of handlers
- **Memento** - Captures and restores object's internal state
- **Visitor** - Separates an algorithm from the object structure

### Creational Patterns
These patterns provide mechanisms to create objects in a controlled way.

#### Most Commonly Used
- ⭐ **Factory Method** - Creates objects without specifying the exact class
- ⭐ **Abstract Factory** - Creates families of related objects

#### Others
- **Builder** - Constructs complex objects step by step
- **Singleton** - Ensures a class has only one instance
- **Prototype** - Creates new objects by copying existing ones

### Structural Patterns
These patterns focus on object composition and relationships between objects.

#### Most Commonly Used
- ⭐ **Adapter** - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- ⭐ **Facade** - Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
- ⭐ **Decorator** - Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically

#### Others
- **Bridge** - Separates an abstraction from its implementation
- **Composite** - Composes objects into tree structures
- **Flyweight** - Minimizes memory usage by sharing common parts of objects
- **Proxy** - Provides a surrogate for another object
