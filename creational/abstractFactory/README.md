# Abstract Factory Pattern

## Problem
Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Open/Closed Principle (OCP) by having a single factory that creates messages for different communication channels.

## Solution
Uses the Abstract Factory Pattern to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes, allowing easy switching between different product families.
