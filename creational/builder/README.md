# Builder Pattern

## Problem
Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) through complex object construction with many parameters and the Telescoping Constructor Problem when there are multiple variants of an object.

## Solution
Uses the Builder Pattern to separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the creation of different types and representations using the same construction code.
