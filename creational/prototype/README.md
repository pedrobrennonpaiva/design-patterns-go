# Prototype Pattern

## Problem
Violation of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle when creating similar objects repeatedly and the Dependency Inversion Principle when code depends on concrete classes rather than abstractions.

## Solution
Uses the Prototype Pattern to create new objects by cloning an existing prototype object, avoiding the need to know specific implementation details of classes.
