# Singleton Pattern

## Problem
Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) when multiple components share global state and the Dependency Inversion Principle by creating rigid dependencies throughout the code.

## Solution
Uses the Singleton Pattern to ensure a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it, maintaining centralized control over shared resources.
